- Using the Euler's totient function and modulo multiplicative inverse function to simulate and Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) Cryptosystem
- Can create public and private keys by converting text first into ascii components, transforming it into ciphertext using public key, and assuming that the receiver has it, it shall be decrypted by a private key.
